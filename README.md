# Sitecore PartDesign Module
Sitecore **PartDesign** provides to any **Vanilla Siteocore XM/XP**, with the same functionalities of [SXA's Partial Design](https://doc.sitecore.com/en/developers/sxa/101/sitecore-experience-accelerator/partial-designs.html): 

 1. Create complex and reusable design elements quickly
 2. Visual content edition experience with Experince Editor
 3. Compatible with [Content Testing](https://doc.sitecore.com/en/developers/sxa/101/sitecore-experience-accelerator/running-a-content-test-on-a-partial-design.html) and Personalization

You can create and update a PartDesign in a very similar way as it's [done with SXA](https://doc.sitecore.com/en/developers/sxa/17/sitecore-experience-accelerator/create-and-change-a-partial-design.html),

The image below shows one example, where the a composed component called "Promo Card" has three inner components, respective to each of the 3 columns:

The same PartDesign can later be easily added to multiple pages:
