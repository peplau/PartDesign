# Sitecore PartDesign

Sitecore PartDesign provides to any vanilla Siteocore XM/XP, with the same functionalities of [SXA's Partial Design](https://doc.sitecore.com/en/developers/sxa/101/sitecore-experience-accelerator/partial-designs.html): from WYSIWYG to content testing and personalization. 

 1. Create complex and reusable design elements quickly;
 2. Compatible with Experince Editor
 3. Compatible with [Content Testing](https://doc.sitecore.com/en/developers/sxa/101/sitecore-experience-accelerator/running-a-content-test-on-a-partial-design.html) and Personalization

You can create and update a PartDesign in a very similar way as it's [done with SXA](https://doc.sitecore.com/en/developers/sxa/17/sitecore-experience-accelerator/create-and-change-a-partial-design.html),
